## Tested toolchain

| Component | Source expectation and tested installation |
| --- | --- |
| Flutter | 3.44.4 stable, framework revision `ad70ec4617` |
| Dart | 3.12.2, supplied by Flutter |
| Repository constraints | `sdk: ^3.12.2`, `flutter: >=3.44.4`; minimum constraints, not an exact SDK manager pin |
| Java | Microsoft OpenJDK 17.0.17; Java/Kotlin JVM target 17 |
| Android | compile/target SDK 36, minimum SDK 24; NDK 28.2.13676358 from this Flutter SDK |
| Gradle / AGP | Wrapper 9.1.0 / Android Gradle Plugin 9.0.1 |
| Kotlin | 2.3.20 declared in settings; existing Flutter compatibility flags retained |
| Apple tooling | Xcode 27.0 (27A266a), CocoaPods 1.16.2 |
| iOS | Deployment target 15.0; CocoaPods integration; Swift Package Manager disabled in pubspec |

Use this tested Flutter version first. Do not automatically upgrade Flutter, Gradle, Kotlin or pods during integration. The host also has newer Android SDK platforms; the app resolves API 36 from Flutter. `flutter doctor` reports Android licence status as unknown on the verification host; actual build outcomes are recorded in [handover status](HANDOVER_STATUS.md). On a new workstation, use `flutter doctor -v` and review/accept applicable SDK licences as the responsible developer.

Native identifiers were checked independently: Android `za.co.developify.developify_mobile` in [app/build.gradle.kts](../android/app/build.gradle.kts), and iOS `za.co.developify.developifyMobile` in [project.pbxproj](../ios/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj). They are provisional distribution identifiers; confirm them before registering production apps. The two portals remain one app per environment.

## Clean extraction and dependencies

Extract the ZIP into an ordinary writable directory. Enter its single `developify-mobile/` root; no files from another checkout are required. Preserve dotfiles and executable permissions. Retained Gradle wrapper scripts/JAR and native projects are included; Flutter regenerates machine-specific files locally.

```sh
flutter --version
flutter pub get --enforce-lockfile
dart run build_runner build
dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed \
  lib test integration_test test_driver tool
flutter analyze
flutter test --reporter expanded
```

`--enforce-lockfile` is supported by the tested Flutter/Pub toolchain. It must fail if locked resolution cannot be honoured; do not delete or regenerate the lockfile to hide a mismatch. Pub and native dependency downloads require network access on a machine without caches. Run commands from the extracted root so asset and test paths resolve correctly.

For iOS on macOS after changing Flutter plugins, run `flutter pub get`, then `(cd ios && pod install)` to refresh [Podfile.lock](../ios/Podfile.lock). The lockfile was pruned to the current Flutter plugin graph on Windows; validate it with CocoaPods on macOS before an iOS release. Once regenerated and reviewed, use `pod install --deployment` for reproducible builds. Open `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`, not the `.xcodeproj`, for native development. Select a locally installed compatible simulator using `flutter devices` or Xcode. A physical iPhone additionally requires an approved signing team and provisioning.

## Configuration

[AppEnvironment.fromDefines](../lib/app/environment/app_environment.dart) reads compile-time `--dart-define` values. There is no `.env` loader. Values are embedded in the application and must never contain server/admin secrets.

| Key | Parser, default and meaning | Safe example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MOCK_MODE` | `bool.fromEnvironment`, defaults false. False selects live backend repositories; true explicitly forces mocks. Live startup fails if the API URL or Supabase client configuration is invalid. | `false` |
| `MOCK_SCENARIO` | String mapped to the cases below; unknown values fall back to success. | `success` |
| `MOCK_DELAY_MS` | `int.fromEnvironment`, defaults 350 milliseconds; malformed values use the default. Use a nonnegative value; the parser itself does not clamp negatives. | `350` |
| `API_BASE_URL` | String, defaults to the hosted Developify API origin. Live mode fails at startup when the URL is invalid; mock repositories are never selected implicitly. `apiUri` accepts HTTPS, or HTTP for localhost, 127.0.0.1 and 10.0.2.2, with no user-info, query or fragment. Do not append `/v1`; API routes include that prefix. | `https://developify-api.onrender.com` |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | String, defaults to the configured Developify Supabase project URL. Live mode uses this for Supabase Authentication. | Project URL |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | String, defaults to the configured publishable key. Client-safe Supabase key only; never use a service-role key in the app. | Project publishable key |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED` | Reserved for a future configured telemetry provider; telemetry integrations are currently disabled. | `false` |

Supported scenario strings: `success`, `empty`, `network_failure`, `low_balance`, `incomplete_kyc`, `pending_verification`, `rejected_verification`, `no_projects`, `no_transactions`, `no_notifications`, `no_portfolio`, `withdrawal_unavailable`, `payment_method_unavailable`, `validation_failure`, `missing_item`. Applicability varies by repository. `network_failure` fails the first request on each affected repository behavior and then permits retry.

For bool defines, use literal `true` or `false`, and avoid personal IDE launch profiles or `--dart-define-from-file` inputs. The mobile app uses Supabase Auth and the authenticated backend; the Supabase service-role key belongs only in the backend's local secret configuration.

## Build and native tests

Normal mock launch:

```sh
flutter run --target lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=MOCK_MODE=true \
  --dart-define=MOCK_SCENARIO=success \
  --dart-define=TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

Launch against the local backend (investor registration is inserted after OTP verification and completion of the security steps):

```sh
flutter run -d web-server --web-hostname 127.0.0.1 --web-port 59497 --target lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  --dart-define=MOCK_MODE=false \
  --dart-define=TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

Before using live mode, configure `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` in `backend/.env`, then start the backend from `backend/`. Never place the service-role key in Flutter defines or the mobile app. The local Supabase Auth redirect allow-list includes `http://127.0.0.1:59497/auth-callback/`, `http://localhost:59497/auth-callback/`, `http://localhost:3001/login`, and `developify://auth-callback/`. Android and iOS register the custom URL scheme in their native project files. Email/password sign-in, signup verification, password-reset codes/links, and password changes use Supabase Auth. Before allowing public signups, enable custom SMTP under Supabase Auth → Emails → SMTP Settings and verify the sender domain; Supabase's default mailer only delivers to project team addresses and has a low rate limit. For Resend, use host `smtp.resend.com`, port `465`, username `resend`, a Resend API key as the SMTP password, and a sender address on the verified domain. Enter these values directly in the Supabase dashboard; do not commit the API key or put it in Flutter defines. Once a verified signup signs in, the backend creates its Developify profile and membership records in the Supabase database from the validated signup metadata.

Existing legacy records have not been imported. Mobile and backend runtime services use Supabase only.

Normal Android build (temporary validation output):

```sh
flutter build apk --debug --no-pub --target lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=MOCK_MODE=true \
  --dart-define=MOCK_SCENARIO=success \
  --dart-define=TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

iOS simulator build command, without distribution signing (currently blocked on the verification host; see the Xcode 27 limitation below):

```sh
flutter build ios --simulator --debug --no-pub \
  --target lib/main.dart \
  --dart-define=MOCK_MODE=true \
  --dart-define=MOCK_SCENARIO=success \
  --dart-define=TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false
```

Native journeys use independent test composition and deterministic fixture data:

```sh
flutter drive --no-pub \
  --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
  --target=integration_test/client_review_test.dart -d DEVICE_ID
flutter drive --no-pub \
  --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart \
  --target=integration_test/landowner_flow_test.dart -d DEVICE_ID
```

Replace `DEVICE_ID` with the actual ID. The first journey covers Investor money/privacy/project flows and portal switching; the second covers Landowner drafts and submission. Also retain `calculator_banner_test.dart`, `investor_flow_test.dart`, `investor_auth_flow_test.dart`, `investor_verification_test.dart`, `investor_amount_test.dart` and `investor_keyboard_test.dart` for focused native checks. Read their setup before running, since they deliberately create test sessions rather than verify a normal production login.

Optional diagnostics are build/test tooling, not application configuration: `CAPTURE_FIDELITY=true` enables screenshot captures for widget regressions; `FIDELITY_OUTPUT` overrides their default `build/test-artifacts/screenshots` location. `CAPTURE_SCREENSHOTS=true` enables basic app-test captures. `CAPTURE_NATIVE_SCREENSHOTS=true` enables optional native captures where supported. The integration driver writes `build/integration-results`, overridable with the shell variable `DEVELOPIFY_TEST_OUTPUT`. `LAUNCHER_PREVIEW_DIR` optionally writes icon previews when running the launcher generator. Generated diagnostics are not required input fixtures.

## Troubleshooting

- Generation: rerun `dart run build_runner build`; never hand-edit `.g.dart`. A stale generated file is a source consistency problem, not a reason to disable analysis.
- Assets: run from the root after Pub resolution. Check [AppAssets](../lib/core/assets/app_assets.dart), [pubspec](../pubspec.yaml) and exact filename case. Do not substitute missing runtime art with removed design references.
- Android: verify Java 17, installed SDK 36/NDK, network and wrapper permissions. `android/local.properties` is created for the current machine. Existing AGP compatibility flags in [gradle.properties](../android/gradle.properties) are intentional; this handover does not migrate the build system.
- iOS: resolve Pub first, then `pod install --deployment`. A lock mismatch needs investigation, not `pod update`. Ensure the selected simulator runtime is installed. Keep the workspace's deployment target at least 15.0 for the pinned native dependencies.
- Optional services: telemetry integrations are disabled and use no-op adapters. Remote push notifications are not included. Consult [the service guide](OBSERVABILITY_AND_NOTIFICATIONS.md).
- Native signing: simulator success does not prove device or store signing. Android `release` currently uses the local debug identity; a new developer's debug identity can differ. Do not distribute that build as production or overwrite installed apps with incompatible signing.

## Current Xcode 27 limitation

The normal universal simulator build failed in Flutter framework architecture verification (`debug_unpack_ios`, Xcode exit 255). A selected iPhone 17 / iOS 26.5 simulator attempt also failed under Xcode 27 with generated dependency targets below the supported iOS 15.0 minimum. No successful fresh iOS build or native journey is claimed for this handover host. The app target itself remains iOS 15.0. Do not silently migrate the native project or upgrade dependencies to hide this result; the receiving team should verify with an agreed compatible Xcode/toolchain before iOS distribution. Android builds and host tests are independently verified.

## Production distribution and environments

The CTO owns package/bundle confirmation, signing certificates/keystores, store accounts, privacy declarations, service registrations and CI access. No private signing material is included. Plan approved development, staging and production configuration with independent service projects and clear release labels. Keep credentials in controlled CI secret storage, not `--dart-define` or source files.

Release-mode QA is useful for performance validation with mock data; it is separate from production signing, server integration and store deployment. Source delivery requires none of those external activations.
