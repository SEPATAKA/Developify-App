# API integration guide

[Documentation entry point](../README.md)

For Ngoako Masetla and the receiving engineering team. This is a map of the delivered interfaces and integration responsibilities, **not a working OpenAPI specification**. Local backend endpoints and API adapters exist, but this guide does not define a deployed production API contract, provider sessions or deployment pipelines.

## Integration status and composition

Repository registrations are in [AppDependencies.create](../lib/app/di/app_dependencies.dart). With `MOCK_MODE=false` (the default) and a valid `API_BASE_URL`, the app registers API-backed auth, investor account/catalogue/KYC, landowner, notification and profile repositories. Only the explicit `MOCK_MODE=true` setting selects mock repositories; live startup fails for invalid configuration rather than falling back to demo data. The API adapters call the configured backend; they do not connect directly to a database.

Replace implementations at this composition root while keeping independent stores, route ownership and typed models. Add agreed server contracts before financial or KYC writes. Some current interfaces deliberately expose synchronous local draft/simulation operations. They are not ready-made network endpoints: introduce explicit asynchronous persistence/quote contracts where required, with targeted tests, rather than hiding unawaited network writes behind synchronous setters.

## Inputs the CTO must supply

- Development/staging/production base URLs, TLS and environment ownership; agreed API schema/versioning and example responses.
- Supabase Auth is the current identity provider; confirm token issuance, refresh rotation, expiry, revocation and logout behavior against the deployed project.
- User/entity membership, roles, object authorization, account selection and session policy for both portals.
- Exact money/rate/fee, quote expiry, capacity, idempotency, ledger, settlement, reconciliation and error specifications.
- Pagination/sorting/filtering, resource IDs, status transitions, timestamps/time zones, server validation field keys and rate limits.
- KYC provider/environment, four entity workflows, document storage, upload limits, review/signature/retention rules and callback verification.
- Payment provider sandbox, tokenization/authorization flow, bank verification and authenticated webhook access.
- Push provider and installation-registry contracts, service project/app identifiers, monitoring owners, privacy/consent rules and signing/CI access.

The Flutter app calls authenticated APIs. The backend uses Supabase Auth, the `developify_documents` JSONB document table, the project’s migration/version tables, and private Supabase Storage for uploaded files. It must never connect directly to the production database or carry server credentials. Transient interface state and unsaved in-progress form state may remain in memory; only server-confirmed writes are durable. A mock-mode run is not evidence of Supabase persistence.

## Integration map

Every area below uses the shared composition root above. Method signatures and models linked here are authoritative; pagination and transport schemas are backend decisions, not currently exposed as cursors in the delivered list interfaces.

### Authentication and recovery

Contract: [AuthRepository](../lib/features/authentication/domain/auth_repository.dart). Implementations: [ApiAuthRepository](../lib/features/authentication/data/api_auth_repository.dart) and [MockAuthRepository](../lib/features/authentication/data/mock_auth_repository.dart).

`signIn(email, password)` signs in through Supabase Auth, requires a verified email, sends the Supabase access token to `/v1/auth/supabase/session`, and returns the matching application profile. Investor signup creates a Supabase email/password account and requests email verification before the backend creates its profile and membership documents. Passwords are sent only to Supabase Auth. Public signup and password recovery require custom SMTP: Supabase's default mailer only delivers to project team addresses and is rate-limited. The Supabase service-role key is server-only.

Admin sign-in also uses Supabase Auth and exchanges its access token at `/v1/auth/admin/supabase-session`. Admin authorization comes from the `adminUsers` document's `role`; protected API requests verify Supabase tokens and enforce admin role metadata. Admin user listing and account locking use the Supabase-backed document store. Social sign-in remains unavailable.

Prove replacement with [authentication tests](../test/investor_authentication_test.dart), [signup tests](../test/investor_signup_test.dart), [mock login/session tests](../test/qa_login_test.dart) and [native auth journey](../integration_test/investor_auth_flow_test.dart). Add staging tests for expired challenge, wrong/used OTP, cancellation, duplicate submission, revoked session and refresh races.

### User, accounts and selected entities

Contracts: [AppUser / EntityType / Experience](../lib/features/shared/domain/app_user.dart), [SessionService](../lib/core/services/session_service.dart), [InvestorAccountContext](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_account_context.dart), and `ProfileRepository.load/update`. `selectEntity(entity, nonResident: ...)` changes local scope; `isCurrent(InvestorScope)` rejects stale results. `InvestorAccountRepository.snapshot()` returns `Result<InvestorAccountSnapshot>`.

Backend work: authorized account/entity catalogue, selected membership, profile and residency data, roles and resource-level authorization. Derive protected ownership from authentication and validate every supplied entity/resource identifier. A portal switch is not a new login. Current selected-entity state is not proof of membership. Introduce pagination only if the membership catalogue needs it, with stable IDs and selection invalidation.

Prove with [context tests](../test/investor_context_test.dart), [account repository tests](../test/investor_account_repository_test.dart) and [routing tests](../test/investor_routing_test.dart): change entity during load, logout during a write, restore a session and reject inaccessible IDs without leaking another entity's data.

### Profile photos and uploaded files

File contents are uploaded by the authenticated backend to the private Supabase Storage bucket; binary files are not stored in document JSON. The server validates type and size and tags each object with its authenticated owner. The app then saves the object key in the Supabase-backed document store: profile-photo keys are stored on `users/{userId}` as `profilePhotoKey`, KYC and landowner upload metadata are stored in the `documents` collection, and payout-proof keys are stored on `payoutAccounts/{userId}`. Selecting a profile photo performs both the Storage upload and profile update immediately; it does not save unrelated unsaved profile edits. If that profile update fails, the app attempts to remove the uploaded object and reports any cleanup failure.

These live flows require the deployed API to include the authenticated upload/profile routes and `SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET` to name the configured private bucket. Mock upload results are in-memory and do not prove Supabase persistence. Confirm a real upload with an authenticated staging account before treating the file as saved.

### Investor catalogue, favourites and search

Contract: [InvestorCatalogRepository](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_repository.dart). Live implementation: [ApiInvestorCatalogRepository](../lib/features/investor/data/api_investor_catalog_repository.dart); demo implementation: [MockInvestorCatalogRepository](../lib/features/investor/data/mock_investor_catalog_repository.dart). `projects() -> Result<List<InvestorProject>>`, `project(id) -> Result<InvestorProject>`, `currentProject(id) -> InvestorProject?`; `changes` is a stream. Favourites and recent searches use authenticated API endpoints in live mode. `currentProject` is a cached read model, not a network call.

Backend work: authoritative project IDs, currency, annual basis-point rate, term/cadence, minimum/capacity/status, filters and stable ordering. Agree cursor pagination before replacing a full-list contract; do not silently drop later pages. Preserve empty results and not-found/forbidden distinctions. Favourites are entity-scoped and need optimistic rollback and last-intent protection. `currentProject` is a local read model, not a network call.

Prove with [filter tests](../test/project_filter_test.dart), [search journey](../test/investor_search_journey_test.dart), [home journey](../test/investor_home_journey_test.dart) and [stores tests](../test/investor_stores_test.dart), including out-of-order favourite responses and scope changes.

### Project details, updates and documents

Models: [InvestorProject](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_project.dart) and [mock project content](../lib/features/investor/data/mock_project_content.dart), loaded by the catalogue interface. `InvestorProjectDetailStore` also resolves investment IDs through the account repository. Documents and updates are model content; there is no production download/upload adapter behind the local preview UI.

Backend work: authorized project/update/document IDs, published versions, availability/status, MIME type/size, safe titles, expiry and signed object access or authenticated streaming. Define gallery content and update pagination; separate unavailable, expired, loading and empty states. Agree download progress/cancellation, malware checks and file retention server-side. Never use a raw client path as object ownership evidence.

Prove with [client review fidelity tests](../test/client_review_fidelity_test.dart), [project/document journeys](../test/client_review_journey_test.dart) and [critical journeys](../test/investor_critical_journey_test.dart). Test empty/long/unavailable files, changed project during loading and denied/expired access.

### Quotes and investment execution

Contracts/models: `InvestorAccountRepository.invest`, `InvestorCatalogRepository.contribute`, [InvestmentProjection / InvestmentPolicy](../lib/features/investor/domain/investment_policy.dart), [InvestmentStore](../lib/features/investor/presentation/stores/investment_store.dart) and [InvestorDrafts](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_drafts.dart). The account implementation is [MockInvestorAccountRepository](../lib/features/investor/data/mock_investor_account_repository.dart).

`invest` takes `InvestorProject`, `MonetaryAmount`, `operationId`, `pin`, optional `InvestmentProjection quote` and the demo-only `simulateBiometric` flag, returning `Result<InvestorOperationReceipt>`. `newOperationId()` generates process-local mock IDs. `contribute(id, amount) -> Result<void>` changes local catalogue capacity synchronously. It is not an independent production financial endpoint. A projection carries no server quote ID, expiry or signature today.

Backend work: quote creation/revalidation, quote ID/expiry, exact transport amounts, minimum/maximum and capacity, KYC eligibility, challenge/PIN or provider authorization and atomic investment execution. Allocate robust server-supported idempotency keys and bind keys to the authenticated user/entity and request fingerprint. Concurrent requests and capacity changes after authorization must never overfund a project. Return authoritative transaction/holding IDs and status; keep the UI journey's project/amount/quote together. Retry an uncertain write only using the same backend-supported key and reconcile its result.

Prove with [transaction tests](../test/investor_transaction_test.dart), [client correction tests](../test/client_review_corrections_test.dart), [policy tests](../test/client_review_policy_test.dart) and [critical journey](../test/investor_critical_journey_test.dart). Exercise fully funded and minimum guards, stale quote, post-PIN capacity change, duplicate/replayed requests, changed key payload, insufficient funds and account switch while pending.

### Wallet, deposits, withdrawals and payment methods

Live mode uses [ApiInvestorAccountRepository](../lib/features/investor/data/api_investor_account_repository.dart). The mobile client sends financial operations to the authenticated backend; it does not write transaction or ledger documents directly from the device. The backend stores financial activity in the `transactions` collection and records balanced money movements in `ledgerEntries`, backed by Supabase JSONB documents. Investment records and their transaction/ledger entries are created atomically through the `developify_commit` database function. The home screen reads the lightweight wallet balance endpoint separately from the full account snapshot; when an older backend returns 404 for that endpoint, the client falls back to the authenticated snapshot. Other errors are surfaced rather than hidden. `addMoney` and `withdraw` emit repository changes after the server accepts the operation so the home, wallet, and transaction views reload their server-backed balances and history. Mock mode is intentionally in-memory and must not be used to validate Supabase persistence.

The default `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=manual` flow is available only when the backend is configured with the merchant's real `DEPOSIT_BANK_NAME`, `DEPOSIT_BANK_ACCOUNT_NAME`, `DEPOSIT_BANK_ACCOUNT_NUMBER`, and `DEPOSIT_BANK_BRANCH_CODE`. Without all four values, manual deposits are hidden in the live app and rejected by the API. A configured EFT creates a pending deposit request; it does not add spendable funds until an administrator confirms that the transfer arrived. Never configure sample or personal bank details as a settlement account. The dashboard displays only the ledger-backed available balance. Withdrawals remain pending approval, and the ledger reserves the amount plus the server-configured fee when the request is accepted.

For sandbox card testing, set `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=paystack`, provide a Paystack **test** secret key (`sk_test_...`) as `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY`, and set a real, publicly reachable HTTPS `PAYSTACK_CALLBACK_URL` (or `API_PUBLIC_URL`). Card checkout is hidden and rejected unless both the test key and HTTPS callback are configured. Configure the Paystack dashboard webhook URL as `https://<api-host>/v1/wallet/paystack/webhook`. The mobile app opens Paystack-hosted checkout; it never collects or transmits card numbers or CVVs. The server verifies both the signed webhook and the transaction directly with Paystack before atomically crediting the ledger and creating an in-app wallet-funded notification. The app checks the pending transaction for confirmation for up to four minutes and refreshes the dashboard balance after the server records the verified credit. A pending or failed checkout never increases the wallet balance. Live Paystack keys are intentionally rejected by this test-mode integration.

The backend's withdrawal fee is configured server-side; do not treat the mock fee in [investor_transfer_fees.dart](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_transfer_fees.dart) as authoritative. List contracts currently return snapshots; agree scalable pagination if needed.

Prove with [live account API tests](../test/api_investor_account_repository_test.dart), [payment-method tests](../test/investor_payment_methods_test.dart), [mock account tests](../test/investor_account_repository_test.dart), [transaction tests](../test/investor_transaction_test.dart) and the [client journey](../test/helpers/client_review_journey.dart). Cover unavailable methods, duplicate writes, pending settlement and status reconciliation.

### Transactions, receipts, holdings and portfolio

`transaction(id)`, `investment(id)` and `snapshot()` return the [InvestorTransaction / InvestorInvestment / InvestorAccountSnapshot models](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_account.dart). Receipt writes return `InvestorOperationReceipt`; rows carry signed transaction amounts, fees, timestamps, references, status and optional recorded project terms. Current receipt presentation uses local models, not an authoritative signed PDF service.

Backend work: stable IDs, UTC timestamps, cursor pagination/filtering, financial reconciliation, recorded schedules/milestones and whether principal remains held. Confirm positive/negative amount conventions and currency. Home total is available wallet plus distinct held principal; projected payouts must not become additional capital. Monthly simple-interest previews do not rewrite historical quarterly schedules. Separate aggregate proceeds, earned-to-date, principal return and final maturity cash, and avoid duplicate credits or immediate-income promises.

Prove with [portfolio analytics](../test/portfolio_analytics_test.dart), [monetary arithmetic](../test/monetary_amount_test.dart), [home journey](../test/investor_home_journey_test.dart) and [transaction tests](../test/investor_transaction_test.dart). Add reconciled server examples for partial settlement, reversal, delayed distributions and matured principal.

### KYC: Individual, Company, Trust and Stokvel

Contract: [KycRepository](../lib/features/investor/domain/kyc/kyc_repository.dart). Implementation: [MockKycRepository](../lib/features/investor/data/mock_kyc_repository.dart). Models/requirements: [kyc_models.dart](../lib/features/investor/domain/kyc/kyc_models.dart), [kyc_plan.dart](../lib/features/investor/domain/kyc/kyc_plan.dart), [EntityType](../lib/features/shared/domain/app_user.dart).

`load(entity) -> Future<Result<KycDraft>>`; `save(draft)` is synchronous. `upload(entity, key, name, bytes, mimeType, cancellation, append, documentId)` and `uploadMemberDocument(...)` return draft results; metadata is simulated and no actual bytes are transported. Delete/save member, allocation and member-draft operations return `Result<KycDraft>`. `invite`, `requestResolutionSignatures`, `submit`, `simulateResolutionSignature`, `simulateRequirementApproval` and `simulateReview` return future draft results. Simulation methods are not acceptable production approvals.

Individual: identity, contact, address, financial/tax and supporting evidence. Company: organisation/representative/member/shareholding information and documents. Trust: trustees, allocations, resolution/signature workflow and supporting evidence. Stokvel: organisation and membership/role/allocation evidence. Use the typed plan's current required field/step keys and saved state; agree provider mapping and compliance rules for all four rather than inferring approval from UI completion counts.

Backend work: durable entity drafts/revisions, upload bytes and type/size validation, secure document IDs, cancellation/retry, provider sessions, authorized invitations/signatures, review/correction status, retention/deletion and authenticated callbacks. Saved changes invalidate related requirement approvals. Local confirmation does not prove identity, review completion or a signature. Extend sync local-edit contracts deliberately for remote persistence/conflict handling. Member/document lists need agreed limits or pagination.

Prove with [KYC tests](../test/investor_kyc_test.dart), [member tests](../test/investor_member_test.dart), [resolution tests](../test/investor_resolution_test.dart), [supporting documents tests](../test/investor_supporting_documents_test.dart), [upload tests](../test/investor_document_upload_test.dart) and [native verification](../integration_test/investor_verification_test.dart). Preserve all four entity journeys, allocation guards, replace/delete/multi-document behavior, failed/retried uploads and scope cancellation.

### Notifications, profile and security

Investor notification methods are `notification(id)` and `markNotificationsRead([id])` on the account repository. Landowner uses [NotificationRepository](../lib/features/notifications/domain/notification_repository.dart), registered to [MockNotificationRepository](../lib/features/notifications/data/mock_notification_repository.dart): `list`, `markRead`, `markAllRead`, `messages`, `sendLocalMessage` return `Result` models/lists. Chat is local and sends nothing externally.

[ProfileRepository](../lib/features/profile/domain/profile_repository.dart), registered to [MockProfileRepository](../lib/features/profile/data/mock_profile_repository.dart), supplies `load/update`, `preferences/updatePreferences`, `payoutAccount/updatePayout`, `securityPreferences/saveSecurityPreferences` and `updateSecurity(action, pin)`. Its security/previous-device values are simulated. [TransactionAuthorization](../lib/core/services/transaction_authorization.dart) is a synchronous mock PIN/biometric abstraction, not a secure server authority.

Backend work: unread counts, stable notification/message IDs, cursor pagination, preferences and channel/topic opt-out, authorized profile updates and audited security/device operations. Agree asynchronous real MFA/PIN/device revocation flows; never send a `simulateBiometric` or `simulateReview` bypass as authority. See [notifications and installation registration](OBSERVABILITY_AND_NOTIFICATIONS.md).

Prove with [security-state tests](../test/security_state_test.dart), [profile-security tests](../test/investor_profile_security_test.dart), [notification tests](../test/notifications_fidelity_test.dart) and [profile tests](../test/profile_fidelity_test.dart). Test logout cleanup, masking semantics, unread state and inaccessible notification targets.

### Landowner properties, submissions, documents, earnings and payouts

Contract: [LandownerRepository](../lib/features/landowner/domain/landowner_repository.dart). Implementation: [MockLandownerRepository](../lib/features/landowner/data/mock_landowner_repository.dart). `overview -> Result<LandownerOverview>`, `properties -> Result<List<Property>>`, `property(id) -> Result<Property>`, `earnings -> Result<EarningsSummary>`. `readDraft(id)` and `saveDraft(SubmissionDraft)` are synchronous local operations; `submit(draft) -> Result<String>` returns the created local property ID. `changes` and balance visibility streams synchronize independent stores. Models: [property.dart](../lib/features/landowner/domain/property.dart), [SubmissionDraft / LocalAttachment](../lib/features/landowner/domain/submission_draft.dart).

Backend work: authorized property ownership, stable draft/property/document IDs, resumable/versioned drafts, actual file transfer, review/offer/status transitions, pagination and server validation. `LocalAttachment` carries sample metadata; no upload bytes or document service is implemented. Financial form strings require validated precise decimal transport and approved server conversion. Earnings summaries are fixture read models, not settlement. Payout account editing uses shared `ProfileRepository.updatePayout(PayoutAccount)`; add server verification, payout execution/status and reconciliation contracts explicitly.

Prove with [submission tests](../test/submission_fidelity_test.dart), [stores tests](../test/stores_test.dart), [payout tests](../test/payout_fidelity_test.dart), [dashboard tests](../test/dashboard_fidelity_test.dart) and [native Landowner journey](../integration_test/landowner_flow_test.dart). Test resume/back/portal switching, repeated submit, missing documents, failed writes and expired sessions without losing or misattributing server drafts.

## Small adapter example (proposal)

This is a **method-level illustration** matching the real `InvestorCatalogRepository.projects()` return type. It is not a complete implementation of that interface. The endpoint path and decoder must be supplied from agreed backend contracts; no endpoint is invented or added to the app.

```dart
final class CatalogueReadAdapter {
  CatalogueReadAdapter(this.client, this.agreedPath, this.decodeProjects);

  final ApiClient client;
  final String agreedPath;
  final List<InvestorProject> Function(Object?) decodeProjects;

  Future<Result<List<InvestorProject>>> projects() {
    return client.request<List<InvestorProject>>(
      path: agreedPath,
      decode: decodeProjects,
    );
  }
}
```

The complete adapter must also implement scope cancellation, current read models, streams, favourites/search behavior and safe disposal, and make pagination explicit. For these Dart types, see [ApiClient](../lib/core/network/api_client.dart) and [catalogue contract](../lib/features/investor/domain/investor_repository.dart). Keep store constructors unchanged where the existing contract suffices.

## Transport, authorization and settlement rules

`ApiClient` requires an HTTPS base and a local absolute request path; it disallows request authorities/schemes and redirects. It uses 15/20/30-second connect/send/receive timeouts, optional bearer attachment, `CancelToken`, typed [error mapping](../lib/core/network/api_error_mapper.dart) and safe method-only debug logging. GET/HEAD can retry once after 200 ms for selected connection failures or 502/503/504; other methods receive one attempt. Keep these restrictions. Single-flight token refresh, refresh rotation, coordinated expiry/revocation cleanup and server error-field decoding are still to be implemented. Token read failure is unauthenticated; the server must reject missing/invalid credentials.

Agree integer cents versus strictly validated decimal-string transport, currency code, basis points and rounding before decoding money. Do not introduce binary floating-point ledger arithmetic. The server owns balances, quotes/rates/fees, capacity, KYC eligibility, settlement and final authorization. UI disabling protects a journey, not an account.

Provider webhooks require authenticated signature verification, replay protection, idempotency and reconciliation on the backend. Handle pending/failed/cancelled/settled states explicitly. Never infer settlement from push payloads, optimistic screens or a local authorization result. Reconcile uncertain writes and reserve capacity atomically with execution.

## Accepted behavior and production decisions

The accepted UI remains intact: Rand/ZAR, R1 minimum, monthly new-project projections, 36-month policy, literal masks, Total Earnings to date and the compact calculator banner. These are not reopened as unresolved visual decisions.

Production input is still needed for canonical catalogue/gallery content and rates, the final withdrawal fee policy, legally approved copy/timing, Trust signature/provider rules and content selection for Home promotions. Runtime currently shows one calculator promotion; an alternate portfolio variant remains available in source. Runtime Trust counts reflect saved valid records rather than contradictory sample counts. Aggregate proceeds and maturity labels need a consistent server/read-model vocabulary. These inputs should refine live data/contracts while preserving accepted presentation.

## Recommended implementation order

1. Confirm environments, contracts, authentication and entity authorization.
2. Connect authentication/profile and one read-only catalogue journey.
3. Connect wallet/account/portfolio read models and reconciliation.
4. Connect KYC and Landowner drafts/documents/submissions.
5. Connect server quotes, transaction authorization and financial writes.
6. Connect installation registration, notifications, monitoring and release controls.
7. Run integration, security and failure-path tests in staging before production.

For each replacement, rerun the full maintained suite and add contract tests against agreed staging responses. Prove authorization and concurrent/idempotent financial behavior server-side; passing Flutter tests alone cannot establish those properties.
